 \section{NP-complete problems concerning Sullivan algebras}
 
 In this section we want to show the 
 $\NPcomplexity$ completeness of certain problems concerning Sullivan algebras. Later we shall see that these problems
 translate directly to topological problems. The Theorems and proofs in this section mainly follow  \cite{Lechuga2000}.
 
 We want our ground ring $R$ to be  $\Q$, hence we only consider rational Sullivan algebras.
 
 \begin{Definition}
  A Sullivan algebra $(\Lambda V, d)$ is called \emph{elliptic} if both $\pi^*(\Lambda V,d)$ and $H(\Lambda V,d)$ have
  finite dimension.
 \end{Definition}
 
 The first result we want to establish is the following:
 
 \begin{Theorem}[Lechuga, Murrilo]
 \label{cohomologyFinTheorem}
  It is a $\NPcomplexity$-hard problem to decide if a given a Sullivan algebra $(\Lambda V,d)$ with $\pi^*(\Lambda V,d)$ finite dimensional 
  is elliptic . 
 \end{Theorem}
 
 In order to prove this Theorem, we first have to establish a somehow technical Lemma:
 
 \begin{Lemma}
 \label{lma:IfAndOnlyIfNonTrivialMorphism}
  Let $\K$ be an algebraically closed field and $(\Lambda V,d)$ a minimal Sullivan
  algebra over $\K$ with finite dimensional $V = {\lbrace V^n \rbrace}_{n \geq 2}$. \newline
  Then $H^*(\Sullivan)$ has finite dimension if and only if   
  the only morphism of differential graded algebras 
  $$ \varphi : \Sullivan \to (\K[\alpha],0) \; |\alpha| = 2 $$ 
  is the trivial one.
 \end{Lemma}

 \begin{proof}
 
  
  We first show ``$\implies$''. A slight modification of Proposition \ref{prop:WellBehavedFiltrations} tells us that we can 
  choose a basis $v_1, \ldots , v_n$ of $V$ such that $d v_i \in \Lambda \langle v_1, \ldots, v_{i-1} \rangle$.
  Next, if we are given a morphism  $ \varphi : \Sullivan \to (\K[\alpha],0) \; |\alpha| = 2 $, we want to show by induction over $k$ that
  $\varphi$ is zero on $v_1 , \ldots, v_k$. Let us assume that $\varphi$ is zero on $v_1, \ldots, v_{k-1}$ then take the
  subalgebra of $\Sullivan$ by factoring out $v_1, \ldots, v_{k-1}$ and consider the induced morphism 
  $\bar{\varphi} \colon (\Lambda \langle \bar{x_k}, \ldots, \bar{x_n} \rangle , \bar{d}) \to (\K[\alpha],0) $
  (note that $\bar{d}(\bar{x_k}) = 0$ by the  choice of basis) . Since $\K[\alpha]$ is zero in odd degrees,
  it follows that $\varphi(x_k) = 0$ for $|x_k|$ odd. Let us now look at $|x_k|$ even,
  it follows from \cite{Felix2001} ( Proposition 32.4 and Theorem 29.5) that 
  $(\Lambda \langle \bar{x_k}, \ldots, \bar{x_n} \rangle , \bar{d})$ has finite category which gives us  $m \in \N$ and the
  following commuting diagram
  
  \centerline {
  \xymatrix{
    (\Lambda \langle \bar{x_k}, \ldots, \bar{x_n} \rangle , \bar{d}) \ar@/^/[r]^{\lambda_m} \ar[rd]_{\pi_m}	& 	
    (\Lambda \langle \bar{x_k}, \ldots, \bar{x_n} \rangle \otimes \Lambda Z(m) , d) 
    \ar[d]^{\zeta_m}_{\simeq} \ar@/^/[l]^{i_m} \\
    & (\Lambda \langle \bar{x_k}, \ldots, \bar{x_n} \rangle / 
    \Lambda^{> m} \langle \bar{x_k}, \ldots, \bar{x_n} \rangle, \tilde{d})
  }
  }
  This allows us to show that $\bar{x_k}^m$ is a coboundary as follows:
  Since the diagram commutes 
  $$0 = \pi_m(\bar{x_k}^m) =   \zeta_m (\lambda_m (\bar{x_k}^m))$$ 
  holds. Since $\zeta_m$ is a quasi isomorphism (and $\bar{x_k}^m$ a cocycle), we get that $\lambda_m (\bar{x_k})$ is a coboundary and
  therefore also $ i_m (\lambda_m (\bar{x_k}^m)) = \bar{x_k}^m$. Coboundaries get mapped to coboundaries and the only coboundary
  in $(\K[\alpha], 0)$ is zero, therefore 
  $(\bar{\varphi}(\bar{x_k}))^m = \bar{\varphi}(\bar{x_k}^m) = 0$. Thus also ( since $\K[\alpha]$ is a domain)
  $$ 0 = \bar{\varphi}(\bar{x_k}) = \varphi( x_k)$$
  Note that the construction above also works for $k = 1$ and that closes the induction.
%  $\Sullivan$ being a minimal Sullivan algebra implies that every $ v \in V^i$ is a $\bar{d}$-cocycle. If we look at powers
%  $[v^k]$ of $[v]$ the finiteness condition on homology implies that this will land in a $0$-module for big enough $k$, hence 
%  $[z^k] = 0$. This is equivalent to $v^k$ being a coboundary. Now consider the induced morphism
%  $$ \bar{\varphi} \colon (\Lambda V^{\geq i} , \bar{d}) \to (\K[\alpha],0)$$
%  Since boundaries get mapped to boundaries $\bar{\varphi}(v^k)$ is a coboundary. Besides, $(\K[\alpha],0)$ is zero in odd degrees thus
%  $0$ is the only coboundary and therefore $\varphi(v^k) = 0$. Now that $(\K[\alpha],0)$ is integer we have 
%  $\varphi(v)= \bar{\varphi}(v) = 0$ and this closes the induction.
%    
 \end{proof}

 The main idea to prove Theorem \ref{cohomologyFinTheorem} is to reduce $k$-COLOUR to deciding if $(\Lambda V,d)$ is elliptic for some special 
 Sullivan algebra $(\Lambda V,d)$ which we will construct as follows: \\
 
 \begin{Construction}
 \label{constructionOfSullivanAlgebra}
 Let $G = (V,E)$ be an undirected, simple, connected, finite graph with vertices $ V = \lbrace v_1, \dotsc , v_n \rbrace $
 and edges $ E = \lbrace (v_r, v_s) \; | \; (r,s) \in J \rbrace$. From this we construct for a given $k \in \N$ the following
 Sullivan algebra $(\Lambda V_{(G,k)} , d)$ : \\
 
 $ V^{even}_{(G,k)} \coloneqq \langle x_1, \dotsc , x_n \rangle $ \; with \; $|x_i| = 2$ \; for \; $ i = 1, \dotsc , n$ \; 
 and \; $dx_i \coloneqq 0$ \\
 
 $V^{odd}_{(G,k)} \coloneqq \langle y_{(r,s)} \rangle$ , $(r,s) \in J$ \; with \; $|y_{(r,s)}| = 2k - 3$ \; and \; $dy_{(r,s)} \coloneqq 
 \sum_{l = 1}^k x_r^{k -l} x_s^{l - 1}$ \\
 
 \end{Construction}

  If $k \geq 3$ the differential of the $y_{(r,s)}$ contains no linear term, hence
  $(\Lambda V_{(G,k)} ,d)$ is minimal for $k \geq 3$.
 
\begin{Lemma}
\label{lma:cohomoly+equations}
 $H^*(\Lambda V_{(G,k)}, d)$ has infinite dimension $\iff$ The system of equations \\
 \begin{equation}
 \label{systemofequations}
 {\lbrace \sum_{l = 1}^k u_r^{k - l} u_s^{l - 1} = 0 \; | \; (r,s) \in J \rbrace}  
 \end{equation}
 
 has a non trivial solution 
 $(\lambda_1 , \dotsc, \lambda_n) \in \C^n$
\end{Lemma}

\begin{proof}
 %TODO Hier sollte noch etwas dazu stehen, dass wir O.B.d.A. (\Lambda V_{(G,k)}, d) \otimes \C als \C Algebra anschauen können
 From Lemma \ref{lma:IfAndOnlyIfNonTrivialMorphism} we already know that $(\Lambda V_{(G,k)},d)$  has infinite dimension if and only if %TODO Referenz einfügen!
 there is a non trivial morphism of differential graded algebras \\
 ${\varphi \colon (\Lambda V_{(G,k)},d) \to ( \C [\alpha] ,\acute{d} = 0)}$ with $|\alpha| = 2$. How can such a morphism look like?
 Clearly $\varphi(x_i) = \lambda_i \alpha$ for some $\lambda_i \in \C$ and $\varphi(y_{(r,s)}) = 0$ for all $(r,s) \in J$ , since 
 $(\C [\alpha] , 0)$ is zero in odd degrees. Furthermore, $\varphi$ must commute with the differentials, hence 
 for all $(r,s) \in J$
 $$ 0 = \acute{d} (\varphi(y_{(r,s)})) = \varphi(dy_{(r,s)}) = \varphi(\sum_{l = 1}^k x_r^{k -l} x_s^{l - 1})
 = \sum_{l = 1}^k \varphi(x_r)^{k -l} \varphi(x_s)^{l - 1}$$
 
 This shows that $(\varphi(x_i))_{i = 1, \dotsc , n}$ must be a solution of \ref{systemofequations}, which is not trivial
 if $\varphi$ is not trivial.
 This also works the other way round and every non trivial solution  $(\lambda_1 , \dotsc, \lambda_n)$ of \ref{systemofequations}
 can be used to define a non trivial morphism $\varphi(x_i) = \lambda_i \alpha$.
 \end{proof}

 \begin{Theorem}
  Let $k \geq 3$ then 
   $G = (V,E)$ is k-colourable $\iff$ $(\Lambda V_{(G,k)},d)$ is not elliptic
 \end{Theorem}

 \begin{proof}
  From the construction of $(\Lambda V_{(G,k)},d)$ we see that  $\pi^*(\Lambda V_{(G,k)},d)$ is finite dimensional, therefore
  we only have to care about its cohomology. Suppose now that $G$ is $k$-colourable and we have a colouring
  $f \colon V \to { \lbrace 1, \dotsc , k \rbrace }$ with $f(x_r) \neq f(x_s)$ for $(r,s) \in J$. Let $\zeta_k$ be a primitive 
  $k$-th root of unity, then for $(r,s) \in J$ it holds that
  
  $$ \sum_{l = 1}^k (\zeta_k^{f(x_r)})^{k-l} (\zeta_k^{f(x_s)})^{l-1}
  = \frac{(\zeta_k^{f(x_r)})^{k} - (\zeta_k^{f(x_s)})^{k}}{ \zeta_k^{f(x_r)} - \zeta_k^{f(x_s)}} = 0
  $$
  
  Hence $(\zeta_k^{f(x_i)})_{i = 1, \dotsc, n}$ defines a non trivial solution of \ref{systemofequations}
  and Lemma \ref{lma:cohomoly+equations} tells us that $(\Lambda V_{(G,k)},d)$ is not elliptic and this shows
  ``$\implies$''. \\
  Let now $(\Lambda V_{(G,k)},d)$ be not elliptic, then Lemma \ref{lma:cohomoly+equations} gives us a non trivial
  solution $(\lambda_1 , \dotsc, \lambda_n) \in \C^n$ of \ref{systemofequations}. We use this solution to construct
  a colouring of $G$. 
  We first observe that $\lambda_i \neq 0$ for all $i$, for this suppose that $\lambda_r = 0$ and let $(r,s) \in J$.
  We then have 
  $$0 =\sum_{l = 1}^k \lambda_r^{k -l} \lambda_s^{l - 1} = \lambda_s^{k-1}$$
  and hence $\lambda_s = 0$. Since G is connected this implies that all $\lambda_i$ are zero which is a
  contradiction to $(\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_n)$ being not trivial.
  
  Next we have
  for $(r,s) \in J$ that $ \lambda_r^k - \lambda_s^k = ( \lambda_r - \lambda_s) 
  \sum_{l = 1}^k \lambda_r^{k - l} \lambda_s^{l - 1} = 0$ . Since $G$ is connected we have 
  $\lambda_1^k = \dotsc = \lambda_n^k$ , which we can wlog assume to equal $1$. Therefore every $\lambda_i$ is a 
  $k$-th root of unity and we can define $f \colon V \to { \lbrace 1, \dotsc , k \rbrace }$ such that 
  $\lambda_i = \zeta_k^{f(x_i)}$. This $f$ now defines a colouring, because if we assume that for a $(i,j) \in J$
  $f(x_i) = f(x_j)$ holds we also get that 
  $$\sum_{l = 1}^k \lambda_i^{k - l} \lambda_j^{l - 1} = \sum_{l = 1}^k (\zeta_k^{f(x_i)})^{k-l} (\zeta_k^{f(x_j)})^{l-1}
  = \sum_{l = 1}^k (\zeta_k^{f(x_i)})^{k-1} = k (\zeta_k^{f(x_i)})^{k-1} \neq 0$$ 
  which is a contradiction to $(\lambda_1 , \dotsc, \lambda_n)$ being a solution of \ref{systemofequations}.
  
 \end{proof}

 Since the construction \ref{constructionOfSullivanAlgebra} is polynomial this also proves Theorem \ref{cohomologyFinTheorem}.
