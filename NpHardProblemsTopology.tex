\section{NP-hard problems in topology}

In this last section we finally want to bring everything together and apply the existence of algebraic
models for spaces and the $\NPcomplexity$-hardness of certain of their properties to problems in topology.
We shall use space to mean topological space and all maps are meant to be continous.

\subsection{Some definitions of topological invariants}


\begin{Definition}
 Let $I^n \coloneqq [0,1]^n$ be the $n$-dimensional unit cube and $\partial I^n$ its boundary.
 The \emph{homotopy groups} of a space $X$ with basepoint $x_0 \in X$ are defined as follows: \newline
 $\pi_n(X) \coloneqq [(I^n, \partial I^n), (X,x_0) ]$ (for $n \geq 0$) is the set of homotopy classes of maps
 $f \colon I^n \to X$ with $f(\partial I^n) = x_0$, where homotopies $h_t$ have to satisfy $h_t(\partial I^n) = x_0$.
 Furthermore, we define the group multiplication by 
 $$ (f \cdot g) (x_1, \ldots, x_n) \coloneqq 
 \begin{cases}
  f(2x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) &\text{for $x_1 \in [0, \frac{1}{2}]$} \\
 
  g(2x_1 - 1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) &\text{for $x_1 \in [ \frac{1}{2}, 1]$}
 \end{cases}
$$
\end{Definition}

Note that collapsing the boundary of $I^n$ yields $S^n$ and we could have defined 
$\pi_n(X) \coloneqq [ (S^n, y_0), (X,x_0)]$ where $y_0$ represents $[\partial I^n]$.

\begin{Remark}
 A connected space $X$ with $\pi_1(X) = 0$ is called \emph{simply connected}. We shall only consider
 simply connected spaces since it can be shown that $\pi_n (X)$ is abelian for $n \geq 2$ 
 (\cite{SWB-334616069} p.\ 340)
 which allows us to consider the \emph{rational homotopy groups}
 $ \pi_n(X) \otimes_{\Z} \Q$ (for $n \geq 2$) of $X$. Rational homotopy groups become interesting since the ``normal''
 homotopy groups of many spaces are virtually not computable by any known method and rational homotopy groups
 still contain much information about the homotopy groups if we forget about torsion.
\end{Remark}

Now we have reached the point where we can finally show the power of Sullivan models explicitly with the following Theorem:

\begin{Theorem}
\label{thm:MainTheoremOfRationalHomotopyTheory}
 Let $X$ be a simply connected space with $H^i(X)$ finite dimensional for all $i \geq 0$ and 
 $(\Lambda V_X, d)$ a minimal Sullivan model of $X$ then the following holds:
 
 $$ \pi_*(X) \otimes \Q \cong V_X$$
 %TODO könnte man anders schreiben, wenn noch mehr Theorie über Sullivan Algebren eingebracht wird.
\end{Theorem}

\begin{proof}
 From  \cite{Felix2001} Theorem 15.11 we cite the essential part of the proof, namely $V \cong Hom_{\Z}(\pi_*(X), \Q)$. 
 From this we get :
 $$ V \cong Hom_{\Z}(\pi_*(X), \Q) \cong Hom_{\Z}(\pi_*(X), Hom_{\Z}(\Q, \Q)) \cong 
  Hom_{\Z}(\pi_*(X) \otimes \Q, \Q) \cong \pi_*(X) \otimes \Q$$
  
  where we have used that $Hom$ and tensor product are adjoint.
\end{proof}

For example, we can now calculate rational homotopy groups of spaces if their cohomology algebra is nice enough. Let us
demonstrate this at the example of spheres:

%TODO ändern!

\begin{Example}
 We know from \ref{ex:MinimalModelOfSpheres} that $\Lambda(v_{2k+1};)$ and $\Lambda(v_{2k}, x_{4k -1}; dx = v^2)$
 define minimal models of the odd and even dimensional spheres. Therefore, we now also know their rational homotopy groups:
 
 \begin{multicols}{2}
  $\pi_i(S^{2k+1}) \otimes \Q \cong
  \begin{cases}
  \Q  	&\text{for $i = 0, 2k+1$} \\
  0 	&\text{else}
  \end{cases}
  $
  
  \columnbreak
  
  $\pi_i(S^{2k}) \otimes \Q \cong
  \begin{cases}
  \Q  	&\text{for $i = 0, 2k, 4k -1 $} \\
  0 	&\text{else}
  \end{cases}
  $
 \end{multicols}
This implies in particular that all homotopy groups of the $n$-sphere are torsion besides in degrees $0, n$
and for $n$ even $2n -1$.
\end{Example}

\begin{Definition}
 A \emph{rational space} is a simply connected space $X$ with $\pi_*(X)$ being a $\Q$-vector space.
 Additionally, a  \emph{rationalisation} of a space $X$ is a rational space $X_{\Q}$ together with a map
 $f \colon X \to X_{\Q}$ such that $\pi_*(f) \otimes_{\Z} id_{\Q}$ is an isomorphism. 
 Furthermore a map $\varphi \colon X \to Y$ for which $\pi_*(\varphi) \otimes \Q$ is an isomorphism is 
 called a \emph{rational homotopy equivalence} and rational homotopy equivalent spaces will be denoted by
 $X \simeq_{\Q} Y$.
\end{Definition}

%TODO schauen ob man da noch mehr dazu schreiben kann.

\begin{Definition}
 The \emph{Lusternik-Schnirrelman category} $cat(X)$ of a space $X$ is the smallest integer $k$ such that 
 $X$ can be covered by open sets $U_1, \ldots, U_{k+1}$ that are all contractible in $X$ which
 means that the inclusions $U_i \xhookrightarrow{} X$ are homotopic to a constant map.
 The \emph{rational Lusternik-Schnirrelman category} $cat_0(X)$ of $X$ is the smallest integer $k$ such that there is a space $Y$
 with $ X \simeq_{\Q} Y$ and $cat \, Y = k$.
\end{Definition}

\begin{Remark}
 It is important that the sets $U_i$ are \textbf{contractible in X}. 
 An example of the difference to the term contractible is $S^n$ which is not contractible but contractible in $\R^{n+1}$. 
\end{Remark}

\begin{Example}
 The Lusternik-Schnirrelman category of a contractible space is $0$ and the converse also holds.
 A sphere $S^n$ is not contractible but can be covered by extended upper and lower hemispheres which
 overlap a little bit at the equator, therefore $S^n$ has Lusternik-Schnirrelman category 1.
\end{Example}

The reader probably noticed that we already defined the Lusternik-Schnirrelman category for Sullivan algebras and
of course these two notions coincide in nice cases:

\begin{Proposition}
 Let $X$ be a simply connected space with $H^i(X)$ finite dimensional for $i \geq 0$ and let $\Sullivan$ be 
 a Sullivan model of $X$ then
 $$ cat \, \Sullivan = cat_0 (X)$$
\end{Proposition}

\begin{proof}
 See \cite{Felix2001} Proposition 29.4. %TODO eventuell hier noch eine Richtung Beweis mit ein bringen
\end{proof}

\begin{Definition}
 We call $b_p (X) \coloneqq dim \, H^p(X)$ the \emph{Betti numbers} of a space $X$.
\end{Definition}

\begin{Example}
 The Betti numbers of $S^n$ are $b_0(S^n) = b_n(S^n) = 1$ and $ b_i(S^n) = 0$ else.
\end{Example}

%TODO mehr Beispiele!
\begin{Definition}
 A simply connected space $X$ is called \emph{rationally elliptic} if both $H^*(X)$ and $\pi_*(X) \otimes \Q$ are finite dimensional.
\end{Definition}

%TODO mehr Erklärungen

\begin{Definition}
 The \emph{rational cup length} $c_0 \,X$ of a space $X$ is the product length of its rational cohomology algebra,
 i.e. 
 $$ c_0 \, X \coloneqq nil \, H^*(X) $$
\end{Definition}



\subsection{$\NPcomplexity$-hard problems in rational homotopy theory}

In this last section we want to translate section \ref{sec:NPSullivan} to topology.

%TODO Besser formulieren!, wir kodieren nur rationalen homotopie typ
\begin{Remark}
 In order to speak about the complexity of computations involving topological spaces we first have to
 fix an encoding of topological spaces in a computer. We therefore restrict ourselves to simply connected
 spaces $X$ with $\pi_*(X) \otimes \Q$ finite dimensional and $H^i(X)$ finite dimensional for all $i \in N$
 (note that this not necessarily requires that $X$ is elliptic). If $X$ is such a space we have that
 its minimal model $(\Lambda V_X, d)$ has finite dimensional $V_X$ and thus
 we can encode $X$ by encoding its Sullivan model using the encoding from 
 \ref{rem:CodingOfSullivanAlgebras}. 
\end{Remark}

\begin{Theorem}[Lechuga, Murillo]
 \label{thm:SpacesDecidingEllipticity}
 It is a $\NPcomplexity$-hard problem to decide if a given simply connected space $X$ with  $\pi_*(X) \otimes \Q$
 finite dimensional is elliptic.
\end{Theorem}

\begin{proof}
 This follows directly from \ref{thm:DecidingEllipticityIsNpHard} as follows:
 Given a Sullivan algebra $\Sullivan$ with $\pi^*(\Lambda V,d)$ finite dimensional we construct the 
 space $| \langle \Sullivan \rangle |$ which is simply connected and 
 $\pi_*(| \langle \Sullivan \rangle |) \otimes \Q$ is finite dimensional. Further, we know that 
 $H^*(| \langle \Sullivan \rangle |) \cong H^*( \Sullivan)$ and therefore the decision problem for 
 spaces is at least as hard as for Sullivan algebras.
\end{proof}

\begin{Remark}
 In fact, we can restrict this result to a smaller class of spaces. If we consider $k = 3$ the spaces resulting from
 the Sullivan algebras $\Sullivan$ constructed in \ref{constructionOfSullivanAlgebra} only have non vanishing rational
 homotopy groups in degree 2 and 3. Consequently, deciding if a simply connected space $X$ with
 $\pi_i(X) = 0$ for $i \neq 0,2,3$ is elliptic is still $\NPcomplexity$-hard and this is a stronger result than
 \ref{thm:SpacesDecidingEllipticity}.
\end{Remark}

\begin{Theorem}
 Computing the Betti numbers of an elliptic space is $\NPcomplexity$-hard.
\end{Theorem}

\begin{proof}
 Computing the Betti numbers of a given elliptic Sullivan algebra $\Sullivan$ is the same as computing
 them for $ | \langle \Sullivan \rangle |$, so the problem is $\NPcomplexity$-hard by \ref{thm:AlgebrasComputingBettiNumbers}.
\end{proof}


In the end we want to have a look at spaces where the rational homotopy is already encoded in the cohomology 
algebra of the space.

\begin{Definition}
 A space $X$ is called \emph{formal} if there is a quasi-isomorphism
 $$ \varphi \colon (\Lambda V_X , d) \to (H^*(X),0)$$
 where $(\Lambda V_X,d)$ is a minimal model of $X$.
\end{Definition}

\begin{Remark}
 If we have a simply connected, formal space $X$ and its cohomology algebra $H^*(X)$ we can compute a minimal Sullivan model
 $\Sullivan$ of $H^*(X)$ and it will also be a minimal Sullivan model of $A_{PL}(X)$ since 
 minimal Sullivan models are unique up to isomorphism (\ref{thm:UniquenessOfModels}). Thus, we can say
 that the rational homotopy type of $X$ (encoded in $(\Lambda V_X,d))$ is a ``formal consequence'' of its 
 cohomology algebra.
\end{Remark}

\begin{Remark}
 \label{rem:EncodingOfFormalSpaces}
 The last remark allows us to have an own computer representation of the rational homotopy type of 
 a formal space $X$ since we only have to store its cohomology algebra. Therefore, we represent a 
 formal space (with finitely generated cohomology algebra) as follows: \\
 Take the cohomology algebra of $X$ and write it as $H^*(X) \cong \Lambda V / I$ where $V$ is a vector
 space and $I$ is an ideal. Then encode $X$ as the generators $v_1, \ldots, v_n$ of $V$ and generators 
 of $I$ of the form $\sum_{i_1 \ldots i_n} \lambda_{i_1, \ldots , i_n} v_1^{i_1} \cdots v_n^{i_n}$.
\end{Remark}

This allows us to formulate another $\NPcomplexity$-hard problem:

%TODO finite complex?
\begin{Theorem}
 Computing the rational cup length $c_0 X$ of a formal space $X$ is $\NPcomplexity$-hard.
\end{Theorem}


%TODO Blödsinn
\begin{proof}
 We shall prove this by reducing  INDSET to the problem  as follows: \\
 Given an instance of INDSET, i.e.\ a graph $G = (V,E)$ with $V = \lbrace v_1 , \ldots , v_n \rbrace$ and 
 $E = \lbrace \, \lbrace v_i, v_j \rbrace \; | \; (i,j) \in S \rbrace$ we construct an algebra 
 $A \coloneqq \Lambda V /I$ where $V \coloneqq \langle x_1, \ldots , x_n \rangle$ with $|x_i| = 3$ and I generated by
 the elements $x_i x_j$ for $(i,j) \in S$. Now let $(\Lambda W,d)$ be a minimal Sullivan model of $(A,0)$ and with this
 $A$ is  the cohomology algebra of the formal space $ | \langle (\Lambda W,d) \rangle | $. This implies that 
 we can encode $| \langle (\Lambda W,d) \rangle |$ by encoding $A$ (as defined in \ref{rem:EncodingOfFormalSpaces}).
 Since the number of generators $V$ equals the number of vertices in $G$ and the number of generators of $I$ equals
 the number of edges of $G$ we have that the encoding of $A$ is linear in the size of $G$ and hence this reduction
 is polynomial.To finish the proof let us now show that the product length of $A$ (and hence the rational cup length of 
 $| \langle (\Lambda W,d) \rangle | $) equals the size of the largest (in terms of number of vertices)
 independent set in $G$. This is fairly easy to see: \\
 Let $(v_k)_{k \in K}$ be the largest independent set in $G$, then by definition for $i,j \in K$ with  $i\neq j$ we have
 that $x_i x_j \notin I$ and therefore $\Pi_{k \in K} x_k \neq 0$ and hence $nil \, A \geq |K|$. On the other hand,
 if $nil \, A = m$ and we hence have a product  $\Pi_{i = 1}^m x_{i_m} \neq 0$ we get by the definition of $I$ that 
 $(v_{i_m})_{i = 1, \ldots, m}$ is a independent set of size $m$. \\In summary, we have shown that if we can compute
 the rational cup length of a formal space $X$ we can compute (with polynomial overhead) the size of the largest
 independent set of a given graph.
 
\end{proof}
