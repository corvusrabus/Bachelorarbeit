\section{Sullivan algebras}

One of the nicest things about rational homotopy theory is that we can assign to every space a (up to a
suited isomorphism) unique algebraic model in form of a so called \emph{Sullivan algebra}. This theory
will be sketched in section \ref{sec:FromSpacesToAlgebras}. These models will contain much information
about the accompanying space and they also have the property that some subclasses of them can be
represented in a computer which allows us to make statements about the complexity of certain topological problems.


\subsection{Definitions}
Although most definitions and Theorems in this section would work fine for a general ground ring $R$, we now want the
ground ring of all modules and algebras considered in this section to be $\Q$.

\begin{Definition}
 Given a free graded module $V = {\lbrace {V^i}\rbrace}_{ i \geq 1} $ we call $(\Lambda V, d)$ a \emph{Sullivan algebra} 
 if it satisfies the following properties :
 
  There exists a filtration of graded subspaces $V(0) \subseteq V(1) \subseteq V(2) \subseteq \cdots $ of $V$
  with $\bigcup_{i \in \N_0} V(i) = V$ such that 
  $$ d(V(0)) = 0 \; \text{and} \; d( V(k)) \subseteq  \Lambda V(k-1) $$
  
 This property is called the \emph{nilpotence} property.
 Furthermore, we call a Sullivan Algebra $(\Lambda V,d)$ \emph{minimal} if $im(d) \subseteq \Lambda^{\geq 2} V$
\end{Definition}

Note that the structure of a Sullivan algebra $\Sullivan$ is completely encoded by the graded module $V$ and its
differential $d$. That is, if we are given a differential (which is a derivation) $d \colon V \to \Lambda V$ then the
universal property of free commutative algebras tells us that $d$ extends uniquely to $d \colon \Lambda V \to \Lambda V$.
Therefore it is enough to specify the differential of a Sullivan algebra $\Sullivan$ on the basis of $V$.


\begin{Proposition}
\label{prop:WellBehavedFiltrations}
 Let $\Sullivan$ be a differential graded algebra with $V = {\lbrace V^n \rbrace}_{n \geq 2}$ and 
 ${im \;d \subseteq \Lambda^{\geq 2} V}$ then $\Sullivan$ is a minimal Sullivan algebra and
 the filtration can be choosen such that $V(i) = V^{i+2} \oplus V(i-1)$ (with $V(-1) = 0$).
\end{Proposition}
\begin{proof}
 The proof of this is mainly a degree argument. We choose the filtration ${V(i) = V^{i+2} \oplus V(i-1)}$ as in the claim
 and show that it satisfies
 the nilpotence condition. Begin with $V(0) = V^2$ and take $v \in V(0)$ then $dv$ lies in
 degree $3$ and $dv \in \Lambda^{\geq 2} V$. But, since $V^0 = V^1 = 0$, it follows that $(\Lambda V)^3$ only contains 
 nonzero elements of wordlength 1, therefore $dv = 0$. 
 It remains to show that for $k \geq 1$, $d(V^{k+2}) \subseteq \Lambda V^{ \leq k+1}$ holds. Take $v \in V^{ k+2}$ then 
 $| dv | = k + 3$ and basically the same argument as before works, if $dv$ contained a term $xy \notin \Lambda V^{\leq k+1}$
 then $|x| = 1$ and $|y| = k + 2$ or $|x| = 0$ and $|y| = k + 3$ but in both cases it holds $x = 0$ thus $xy = 0$.
\end{proof}

To get a better understanding of Sullivan algebras we will now present some examples.

\begin{Example}
 First we want to present an algebra which is not a Sullivan algebra. 
 Consider the graded $\Q$-vector space $V = \langle x,y,z \rangle$ with $|x| = |y| = |z| = 1$ and 
 equip it with a differential $d$ which is defined by $dx = yz$ , $dy = xz$, $dz = xy$. \newline
 If $\Sullivan$ was a Sullivan algebra it would be minimal since 
 the differential only hits elements of wordlength greater $2$. But this tells us that we could choose a filtration 
 ${\lbrace V(i) \rbrace}_{i \geq 0}$ for
 the nilpotence condition which respects the degree of elements, hence $ x $ would be in some $V(i)$ and $yz$ in some $V(j)$
 with $i \leq j$ but this contradicts $dx \in \Lambda V(i-1)$ ($x$ can not be in $V(0)$ since it is not a cocycle).
%TODO das mit der Indizierung checken + Überarbeiten!
 \end{Example}

\begin{Remark}
 Many example Sullivan algebras follow the same structure and we want to have a brief representation of them.
 Therefore, we introduce the following notation: \newline
 We write $\Lambda (a_i , b_j, \ldots, x_k ; d x = a)$ to mean the Sullivan algebra
 $(\Lambda \langle a, b, \ldots, x \rangle , d) $ with $|a| = i$, $|b| = j$, $|x| = k$, $d x = a$ and
 $dy = 0 $ for all other generators $y$, i.e. the subscripts denote the degree of the indexed generator and
 we only specify the differential on elements which get not mapped to zero.
\end{Remark}
%TODO Kann auch weg gelassen werden, je nachdem ob ich das nochmal benutze




Next we want to show that Sullivan algebras provide ``good understandable models'' for the homology of commutative cochain algebras. That motivates
the following definition:

\begin{Definition}
  A \emph{Sullivan model} of a commutative cochain algebra $(A,d)$ is a Sullivan algebra $\Sullivan$ with a quasi-isomorphism
  $\varphi \colon \Sullivan \overset{\simeq}{\to} (A,d)$. If $\Sullivan$ is minimal we also speak of a 
  \emph{minimal Sullivan model}.
\end{Definition}

\begin{Example}
\label{ex:MinimalModelOfSpheres}
 To become familiar with this concept let us quickly compute a minimal Sullivan model of the cohomology 
 algebra $(A_n,d) \coloneqq H^*(S^n) = (\Q [\alpha] / (\alpha^2), 0)$ (with $|\alpha| = n$) of the
 $n$-sphere. If $n$ is odd this is fairly easy since we can define 
 $\varphi \colon \Lambda (v_n;) \to (A_n,d)$ by $v \mapsto \alpha$. This is a quasi-isomorphism since $n$ being odd implies
 $ v^2 = 0$. \\
 Now one can probably see the problem with $n$ even, since $v^2 \neq 0$ for $n$ even. Therefore, also 
 $[v^2] \neq 0$ but $(H^{2n}(\varphi)) ([v^2]) = 0$ and $\varphi$ would not be injective. Thus, we have to ``kill'' $v^2$
 in homology by introducing a new element that maps to $v^2$. Therefore, define
 $\varphi \colon \Lambda(v_n, x_{2n -1}; dx = v^2) \to (A_n,d)$ by $v \mapsto \alpha$ and $ x \mapsto 0$.
 This now defines a quasi-isomorphism.
\end{Example}

\begin{Remark}
\label{rem:MinimalSullivanModelsExist}
This definition becomes interesting since it can be shown that every connected commutative cochain algebra has a minimal Sullivan model
(\cite{Felix2001} Theorem 14.12). However the proof of this is not constructive and we want to prove a simpler 
version that can be algorithmically obtained and will suffice for later use .
\end{Remark}

\begin{Theorem}
 \label{thm:MinimalSullivanModelsExistForSimplyConnected}
 Every simply connected commutative cochain algebra has a minimal Sullivan model.
\end{Theorem}

In the case of the last theorem the model can be obtained by an algorithm which we will use to prove the theorem.

\begin{Algorithm}
\label{alg:ConstructionOfMinimalSullivanAlgebra}
 Suppose $(A,d)$ is a simply connected cochain algebra, we inductively construct a Sullivan algebra $\Sullivan$ and a morphism
 $\varphi \Sullivan \to (A,d)$ as follows:
 
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item \label{itm:FirstAlgorithmStep} Choose a basis $([v_i])_{i \in I}$ of $H^2(A,d)$, define $V^2 \coloneqq \langle (\alpha_i)_{i \in I} \rangle$ and
  $\varphi_2 \colon (\Lambda V^2,0) \to (A,d)$ by $\varphi_2(\alpha_i) = v_i$. This clearly induces an isomorphism 
  $H^2(\varphi_2) \colon H^2(\Lambda V^2, 0) \overset{\cong}{\to} H^2(A,d)$.
   
   We now proceed inductively and assume that we have constructed (for $k \geq 2$) $(V^{\leq k}, d)$ and
   ${\varphi_k \colon (\Lambda V^{\leq k}, d) \to (A,d)}$ which is a homology isomorphism in degrees $\leq k$.
   Next we want to extend this to a map $\varphi_{k+1} \colon (\Lambda V^{k+1}, d) \to (A,d)$ with 
   ${\varphi_{k+1}}_{|V^k} = \varphi_k$, $H^{k+1}(\varphi_{k+1})$ bijective and $H^{k + 2}(\varphi_{k+1})$ injective.
   
   \item \label{itm:first} Choose elements $(v_i)_{i \in I} \subset A^{k+1}$ such that
   
   $$H^{k+1}(A,d) = im \; H^{k+1}(\varphi_k) \; \oplus \; \bigoplus_{i \in I} \; \langle [v_i] \rangle $$
   
   \item \label{itm:third} Further choose cocycles $(c_j)_{j \in J} \subset (\Lambda V^{\leq k})^{k+2}$ with
   $$ ker \; H^{k+2}(\varphi_k) = \bigoplus_{j \in J} \; \langle [c_j] \rangle$$
   
   \item By construction the $(\varphi_k(c_j))_{j \in J}$ are coboundaries and we can choose 
   $(w_j)_{j \in J} \subset A^{k+1}$ with $\varphi_k (c_j) = d(w_j)$.
   \item \label{itm:second} Let 
   $V^{k+1}$ be the vector space generated by the formal basis $(\alpha_i)_{i \in I} \cup (\beta_j)_{j \in J}$. We extend $d$
   to a derivation in $\Lambda V^{\leq k+1}$ by $d \alpha_i = 0$ and $d \beta_j = c_j$. Moreover, we extend $\varphi_k$
   to $\varphi_{k+1} \colon \Lambda V^{ \leq k+1} \to A$ by $\varphi_{k+1} (\alpha_i) = v_i$ and 
   $\varphi_{k+1} (\beta_j) = w_j$. Go to \ref{itm:first} and repeat the process for $k+1$.
 \end{enumerate}

\end{Algorithm}
Let us gather some properties of this algorithm:
\begin{Proposition}
 Let $(A,d)$ be a simply connected cochain algebra and $m \colon \Sullivan \to (A,d)$ the morphism which
 algorithm \ref{alg:ConstructionOfMinimalSullivanAlgebra} produces for $(A,d)$. Then the following properties hold:
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item $m$ is a minimal Sullivan model for $(A,d)$
  \item Let $r$ be the least integer greater zero with $H^r(A) \neq 0$ then $V^i = 0$ for $1 \leq i < r$ and
    $H^r(m) \colon V^r \overset{\cong}{\to} H^r(A)$
  \item Let $r$ be the smallest integer with $H^r(A)$ infinite dimensional (or else $\infty$) then
    all $V^k$ for $k < r$ are finite dimensional.
 \end{enumerate}

\end{Proposition}
Note that this Proposition also proves \ref{thm:MinimalSullivanModelsExistForSimplyConnected}.
\begin{proof}
\begin{enumerate}
 \item 

 First observe that $\Sullivan$ actually is a Sullivan Algebra, by construction the filtration $V(i) \coloneqq V^{i+2}$ satisfies
 the nilpotence condition and further the choice of the differential in step \ref{itm:second} implies that $\Sullivan$ is minimal.
 Next we want to see that $m$ is a quasi-isomorphism, for this we show by induction over $k \geq 2$ that
 $H^i(m_k)$ is an isomorphism for $i \leq k$ and injective for $ i = k +1$. The case $k = 2$ is clear since $m_2$ is chosen
 as an isomorphism in \ref{itm:FirstAlgorithmStep}. Now if $k > 2$ it holds by induction hypothesis (since $m_k$ extends
 $m_{k-1}$) that $H^i(m_k)$ is surjective for $i < k$ and by the choice of elements in \ref{itm:first} also for $i = k$.
 Further, $H^i(m_k)$ is injective by induction hypothesis for $i < k$. Additionally, $H^{k+1}(m_k)$ is injective since
 all elements $[z] \in ker \; H^{k+1}(m_k)$ lie in $\Lambda V^{<k}$ (since $V^1 = 0$) and therefore are
 coboundaries by step \ref{itm:third}. At last, consider $[z] \in ker \; H^k (m_k)$, we can write (using the notation used in
 the algorithm)
 $$z = \sum_{i \in I} \alpha_i \lambda_{\alpha_i} + \sum_{j \in J} \beta_j \lambda_{\beta_j} 
 + r \quad \text{with $r \in \Lambda V^{<k}$ }$$
 
 applying the differential to this yields
 $ -dr = d(\sum_{j \in J} \beta_j \lambda_{\beta_j}) = \sum_{j \in J} \lambda_{\beta_j} c_j$
 and taking homology in this equation gives $ [0] = \sum_{j \in J} \lambda_{\beta_j} [c_j]$ and since
 $[c_j] \neq 0$ for all $j \in J$ by the choice of the $c_j$, we get that $\lambda_{\beta_j} = 0$ for all $j \in J$ and 
 therefore $dr = 0$. We also have:
 $$0 = H^{k}(m_k)(z) = (H^k(m_k))( \sum_{i \in I} \alpha_i \lambda_{\alpha_i} ) + (H^k(m_{k-1}))(r)
    = \sum_{i \in I} \lambda_{\alpha_i} [v_i] + (H^k(m_{k-1}))(r) $$
    
and by choice of the $[v_i]$ it follows that $\lambda_{\alpha_i} = 0$ and therefore 
$ [z] = [r] \in H^k ( m_{k+1})$ and by induction hypothesis $[z] = 0$ follows.

 \item Follows immediately from the construction.
 \item Let wlog $r > 2$ then $V^2 \cong H^2(A,d)$ is finite dimensional. Now we can proceed inductively, $V^k$ is by construction 
 direct sum of a subspace of $H^k(A,d)$ and a subspace of $(\Lambda V^{ <k })^k$ and therefore is finite dimensional since
 the latter two are by induction hypothesis and by requirement for $k<r$.
 \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

The next definition is about homotopy groups of a Sullivan algebra, of course they bear that name since we will later
associate them with homotopy groups of a topological space which gets modeled by the Sullivan model.

\begin{Definition}
 Let $\Sullivan$ be a Sullivan algebra, we define its complex of \emph{indecomposables} as
 $(Q(\Lambda V),\bar{d}) \coloneqq (\Lambda V / \Lambda^{\geq 2} V , \bar{d})$ where $\bar{d}$ is the induced differential.
 Given this we define the \emph{(dual) homotopy groups} of $\Sullivan$ by 
 $$ \pi^n ( \Sullivan) \coloneqq H^n(Q(\Lambda V),\bar{d}) \quad \text{for $n \geq 1$}$$
\end{Definition}

\begin{Remark}
 If $\Sullivan$ is a minimal Sullivan algebra then its homotopy groups can be obtained fairly simple. The minimality property
 implies that the differential on the complex of indecomposables of $\Sullivan$ is zero and hence taking
 homology does not change anything. Therefore, 
 $$ \pi^n ( \Sullivan) = H^n(Q(\Lambda V),0) \cong V^n$$
\end{Remark}

\subsection{Relative Sullivan algebras}

Sullivan algebras are sometimes not enough to describe some aspects and we therefore introduce somehow more sophisticated
Sullivan algebras, called relative Sullivan algebras.

\begin{Definition}
 We call $(B \otimes \Lambda V,d)$ a \emph{relative Sullivan algebra} if it satisfies the following:
 
 \begin{itemize}
  \item $(B,d) \coloneqq (B \otimes 1, d)$ is a a connected sub cochain algebra.
  \item $1 \otimes V = V = { \lbrace V^p \rbrace}_{ p \geq 1}$ is a graded vector space.
  \item There is a filtration $V(0) \subseteq V(1) \subseteq V(2) \subseteq \ldots$ of graded subspaces
    with  $ V = \bigcup_{k = 0}^{\infty} V(k)$ such that 
    \begin{align*}
     d(V(0)) \subseteq B &  & \text{and} & & d(V(k)) \subseteq B \otimes \Lambda (V(k-1)) \quad \text{for $k \geq 1$.}
    \end{align*}
 \end{itemize}
 Moreover, $(B \otimes \Lambda V,d)$ is called \emph{minimal} if 
 $im \, d \subseteq B^{\geq 1} \otimes \Lambda V + B \otimes \Lambda^{\geq 2} V$.
\end{Definition}

\begin{Remark}
 Note that for $B = \Q$ the definition of Sullivan algebra and relative Sullivan algebra are the same.
\end{Remark}

\begin{Definition}

 A \emph{Sullivan model} for a morphism $\varphi \colon (B,d) \to (C,d)$ of commutative cochain algebras is
 a relative Sullivan algebra $\RelSullivan$ and a quasi-isomorphism
 $$ m \colon \RelSullivan \overset{\simeq}{\to} (C,d) $$
 such that $\restr{m}{B} = \varphi$ 
\end{Definition}

\begin{Proposition}
\label{prop:ExistenceMorphismSullivanModels}
 A morphism $\varphi \colon (B,d) \to (C,d)$ of commutative cochain algebras has a Sullivan model
 if $H^0(B) = \Q = H^0(C)$ and $H^1(\varphi)$ is injective.
\end{Proposition}
\begin{proof}
 Refer to \cite{Felix2001} (Proposition 14.3).
\end{proof}

\subsection{Properties of Sullivan Algebras}
Here we want to introduce some notations for properties of Sullivan algebras. It will often occur that it is not 
immediately clear why some properties of Sullivan algebras could be interesting and why we give them a name. But, we assure
the reader that we shall later see that all these definitions correspond 1:1 to topological properties which
get modeled by Sullivan algebras.

Let $\Sullivan$ be a Sullivan algebra and consider the projection 
$\varrho_m \colon \Sullivan \to (\Lambda V / \Lambda^{> m} V , d)$ for $m \geq 1$, then $H^1(\varrho_m)$ is injective.
Therefore, Proposition \ref{prop:ExistenceMorphismSullivanModels} tells us that there is a Sullivan model

\centerline{
\xymatrix{
\Sullivan \ar[r]^(.35){\lambda_{m}} \ar[rd]_{\varrho_m} &
(\Lambda V \otimes \Lambda Z(m) , d)
\ar[d]^{\zeta_m}_{\simeq} \\

}
}

of $\varrho_m$ (where $Z(m)$ is just a notation for the Sullivan algebra which models $\varrho_m$ in dependence of $m$).

\begin{Definition}
\label{def:LSCategory}
 The \emph{(Lusternik-Schnirrelmann) category} of a Sullivan Algebra $\Sullivan$ is (using the notation from above) the 
 least integer $m$ (or $\infty$) such that there exists a morphism 
 $\pi_m \colon (\Lambda V \otimes \Lambda Z(m) , d) \to \Sullivan$ with $\pi_m \circ \lambda_m = id_{\Lambda V}$.
 It will be denoted by $cat \, \Sullivan$.
\end{Definition}

\begin{Definition}
 The \emph{product length} of a cochain algebra $A$ is the smallest integer $n$ (or $\infty$) such that 
 $\Pi_{i = 1}^{n+1} a_i = 0$  for all $a_i \in A$. It will be denoted by $nil \,A$.
\end{Definition}

\begin{Example}
 The product length of $\Lambda \langle x \rangle$ is 2 for $|x|$ odd and $\infty$ for $|x|$ even
 (see \ref{ex:FreeCommutativeEvenDegrees} and \ref{ex:FreeCommutativeOddDegrees}).
\end{Example}

\begin{Proposition}
%  \begin{enumerate}
%   \item 
  A Sullivan algebra $\Sullivan$ has category $ \leq m$ if and only if there exists a diagram of commutative cochain
  algebras 
  
  \centerline{

  \Sullivan \ar[r]^f 	&(A,d) \ar[r]^g \ar[d]^{\eta}_{\simeq} &(C,d) \\

  }
  
  where $gf$ is a quasi-isomorphism and $nil \,B \leq m$.
%   \item Quasi isomorphic Sullivan algebras have the same category.
%  \end{enumerate}
\end{Proposition}

\begin{proof}
% \begin{enumerate}
%  \item 

 Let $\Sullivan$ be a Sullivan algebra with $cat \, \Sullivan = m$ then the diagram

  }
(where we used the maps from \ref{def:LSCategory}) fulfills the desired properties.
For the other direction see \cite{Felix2001} p.385.

\begin{Definition}
 If $\Sullivan$ is a Sullivan algebra with $V$ finite dimensional, $d(V^{even}) = 0$
 and $d(V^{odd}) \subseteq \Lambda V^{even}$ we say that $\Sullivan$ is a \emph{pure Sullivan algebra}.
\end{Definition}

For a Sullivan algebra $\Sullivan$ let us denote $ Q \coloneqq V^{even}$ and $P \coloneqq V^{odd}$.
If $\Sullivan$ is pure then the requirements on the differential induce a sequence

\centerline{
\xymatrix{
\cdots \ar[r]^(.35)d &\Lambda Q \otimes \Lambda^2 P \ar[r]^(.55)d &Q \otimes P \ar[r]^d & \Lambda Q \ar[r]^(.55)d &0 
}
}

which we can regard as a differential graded module $(M,d)$ with $0$ in degrees $\geq 1$, $\Lambda Q$ in degree $0$,
$Q \otimes P$ in degree $-1$ and so on.
We denote the homology of this sequence by $H_k(\Lambda V,d) \coloneqq H^{-k}(M,d)$. In particular, this yields
$ H(\Lambda V,d) = \bigoplus_k H_k(\Lambda V,d)$. \par
For an element $x \otimes y \in \Lambda Q \otimes P$ we have 
$ d( x \otimes y) = dx \otimes y + x \otimes dy = x \otimes dy$. This shows that
$d( \Lambda Q \otimes P) = d(P) \cdot \Lambda Q$ and further
$$H_0(\Lambda V, d) \cong \Lambda Q / \Lambda Q \cdot d(P)$$

\begin{Proposition}
\label{prop:FiniteDimensionDependentOnDegreeOne}
 For a pure Sullivan algebra $\Sullivan$ the following holds :
 
  $H(\Lambda V,d)$ is finite dimensional if and only if $H_0(\Lambda V,d)$ is finite dimensional.
 
\end{Proposition}

\begin{proof}
 From left to right is obvious, so let us consider that $H_0(\Lambda V,d)$ is finite dimensional.
 We will show that $H(\Lambda V, d)$ is finitely generated as $H_0 \Sullivan$-module and this implies the claim.
 First observe that $\Lambda Q$ is a polynomial ($\Q$-)algebra in finitely many generators and thus noetherian by
 Hilbert's basis theorem. This implies that $\Lambda V$ is a noetherian $\Lambda Q$-module since it is 
 finitely generated by all products of basis elements in $ P$. Next observe that
 $ker \, d$ is a $\Lambda Q$-module, since for $x \in ker \, d$ and  $y \in \Lambda Q$ we have
 $$ d(x \cdot y) = dx \cdot y + x \cdot dy = 0 + 0 = 0$$
 using $d(\Lambda Q) = 0$. Therefore, $\ker \, d$ is a $\Lambda Q$-submodule of $\Lambda V$ and thus 
 finitely generated by some elements $x_1, \ldots, x_n$. Taking homology yields that $[x_1], \ldots, [x_n]$
 are generators of $H \Sullivan$ as $H_0 \Sullivan$-module.

\begin{Definition}
 Let $\Sullivan$ be a Sullivan algebra with $V$ finite dimensional, we define its 
 \emph{associated pure Sullivan algebra} $(\Lambda V, d_{\sigma})$ by :

  d_{\sigma} (Q) = 0 & & \text{and} & & d_{\sigma}(p) = \pi_{\Lambda Q} \circ d(p) \quad \text{for $p \in P$}

 where $\pi_{\Lambda Q} \colon \Sullivan \to \Lambda Q$ denotes the projection.

 One can show that the associated pure Sullivan algebra always is a pure Sullivan algebra ( \cite{Felix2001} p.438).

\begin{Proposition}
\label{prop:EquivalenceFiniteDimensionCategoryCohomology}
 If $\Sullivan$ is a minimal Sullivan algebra with $V = V^{\geq 2}$ finite dimensional then the following conditions
 are equivalent:

  \item $H(\Lambda V, d)$ is finite dimensional
