\section{Sullivan algebras}

\subsection{Definitions}
Although most definitions and Theorems in this section would work fine for a general ground ring $R$, we now want the
ground ring of all modules and algebras considered in this section to be $\Q$.

\begin{Definition}
 Given a free graded module $V = {\lbrace {V^i}\rbrace}_{ i \geq 1} $ we call $(\Lambda V, d)$ a \emph{Sullivan algebra} 
 if it satisfies the following properties :
 
  There exists a filtration of graded subspaces $V(0) \subseteq V(1) \subseteq V(2) \subseteq \cdots $ of $V$
  with $\bigcup_{i \in \N_0} V(i) = V$ such that 
  $$ d(V(0)) = 0 \; \text{and} \; d( V(k)) \subseteq  \Lambda V(k-1) $$
  
 This property is called the \emph{nilpotence} property.
 Furthermore, we call a Sullivan Algebra $(\Lambda V,d)$ \emph{minimal} if $im(d) \subseteq \Lambda^{\geq 2} V$
\end{Definition}

Note that the structure of a Sullivan algebra $\Sullivan$ is completely encoded by the graded module $V$ and its
differential $d$. That is, if we are given a differential (which is a derivation) $d \colon V \to \Lambda V$ then the
universal property of free commutative algebras tells us that $d$ extends uniquely to $d \colon \Lambda V \to \Lambda V$.
Therefore it is enough to specify the differential of a Sullivan algebra $\Sullivan$ on the basis of $V$.
To get a better understanding of this structure we will now present some examples.

\begin{Example}
 First we want to present an algebra which is not a Sullivan algebra. 
 Consider the graded $\Q$-vector space $V = \langle x,y,z \rangle$ with $|x| = |y| = |z| = 1$ and 
 equip it with a differential $d$ which is defined by $dx = yz$ , $dy = xz$, $dz = xy$. \newline
 If $\Sullivan$ was a Sullivan algebra it would be minimal since 
 the differential only hits elements of wordlength greater $2$. But this tells us that we could choose a filtration 
 ${\lbrace V(i) \rbrace}_{i \geq 0}$ for
 the nilpotence condition which respects the degree of elements, hence $ x $ would be in some $V(i)$ and $yz$ in some $V(j)$
 with $i \leq j$ but this contradicts $dx \in \Lambda V(i-1)$ ($x$ can not be in $V(0)$ since it is not a cocycle).
\end{Example}


\begin{Proposition}
\label{prop:WellBehavedFiltrations}
 Let $\Sullivan$ be a differential graded algebra with $V = {\lbrace V^n \rbrace}_{n \geq 2}$ and 
 ${im \;d \subseteq \Lambda^{\geq 2} V}$ then $\Sullivan$ is a minimal Sullivan algebra and
 the filtration can be choosen such that $V(i) = V^{i+2}$.
\end{Proposition}
\begin{proof}
 The proof of this is mainly a degree argument. We choose the filtration ${V(i) = V^{i+2}}$ as in the claim
 and show that it satisfies
 the nilpotence condition. Begin with $V(0) = V^2$ and take $v \in V(0)$ then $dv$ lies in
 degree $3$ and $dv \in \Lambda^{\geq 2} V$. But, since $V^0 = V^1 = 0$, it follows that $(\Lambda V)^3$ only contains 
 nonzero elements of wordlength 1, therefore $dv = 0$. 
 It remains to show that for $k \geq 1$, $d(V^{k+2}) \subseteq \Lambda V^{k+1}$ holds. Take $v \in V^{k+2}$ then 
 $| dv | = k + 3$ and basically the same argument as before works, if $dv$ contained a term $xy \notin \Lambda V^{k+1}$
 then $|x| = 1$ and $|y| = k + 2$ or $|x| = 0$ and $|y| = k + 3$ but in both cases it holds $x = 0$ thus $xy = 0$.
\end{proof}




Next we want to show that Sullivan algebras provide ``good understandable models'' for the homology of commutative cochain algebras. That motivates
the following definition:

\begin{Definition}
  A \emph{Sullivan model} of a commutative cochain algebra $(A,d)$ is a Sullivan algebra $\Sullivan$ with a quasi-isomorphism
  $\varphi \colon \Sullivan \overset{\simeq}{\to} (A,d)$. If $\Sullivan$ is minimal we also speak of a 
  \emph{minimal Sullivan model}.
\end{Definition}

\begin{Remark}
\label{rem:MinimalSullivanModelsExist}
This definition becomes interesting since it can be shown that every connected commutative cochain algebra has a minimal Sullivan model
(\cite{Felix2001} Theorem 14.12). However, we want to prove a simpler version that will suffice for later use and can
be algorithmically obtained.
\end{Remark}

\begin{Theorem}
 Every simply connected commutative cochain algebra has a minimal Sullivan model.
\end{Theorem}

In the case of the last theorem the model can be obtained by an algorithm which we will use to prove the theorem.

\begin{Algorithm}
 Suppose $(A,d)$ is a simply connected cochain algebra, we inductively construct a Sullivan algebra $\Sullivan$ and a morphism
 $\varphi \Sullivan \to (A,d)$ as follows:
 
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item Choose a basis $([v_i])_{i \in I}$ of $H^2(A,d)$, define $V^2 \coloneqq \langle (\alpha_i)_{i \in I} \rangle$ and
  $\varphi_2 \colon (\Lambda V^2,0) \to (A,d)$ by $\varphi_2(\alpha_i) = v_i$. This clearly induces an isomorphism 
  $H^2(\varphi_2) \colon H^2(\Lambda V^2, 0) \overset{\cong}{\to} H^2(A,d)$.
   
   We now proceed inductively and assume that we have constructed (for $k \geq 2$) $(V^{\leq k}, d)$ and
   ${\varphi_k \colon (\Lambda V^{\leq k}, d) \to (A,d)}$ which is a homology isomorphism in degrees $\leq k$.
   Next we want to extend this to a map $\varphi_{k+1} \colon (\Lambda V^{k+1}, d) \to (A,d)$ with 
   ${\varphi_{k+1}}_{|V^k} = \varphi_k$, $H^{k+1}(\varphi_{k+1})$ bijective and $H^{k + 2}(\varphi_{k+1})$ injective.
   
   \item \label{itm:first} Choose elements $(v_i)_{i \in I} \subset A^{k+1}$ such that
   
   $$H^{k+1}(A,d) = im \; H^{k+1}(\varphi_k) \; \oplus \; \bigoplus_{i \in I} \; \langle [v_i] \rangle $$
   
   \item Further choose cocycles $(c_j)_{j \in J} \subset (\Lambda V^{\leq k})^{k+2}$ with
   $$ ker \; H^{k+2}(\varphi_k) = \bigoplus_{j \in J} \; \langle [c_j] \rangle$$
   
   \item By construction the $(\varphi_k(c_j))_{j \in J}$ are coboundaries and we can choose 
   $(w_j)_{j \in J} \subset A^{k+1}$ with $\varphi_k (c_j) = d(w_j)$.
   \item Now let 
   $V^{k+1}$ be the vector space generated by the formal basis $(\alpha_i)_{i \in I} \cup (\beta_j)_{j \in J}$. We extend $d$
   to a derivation in $\Lambda V^{\leq k+1}$ by $d \alpha_i = 0$ and $d \beta_j = c_j$. Moreover, we extend $\varphi_k$
   to $\varphi_{k+1} \colon \Lambda V^{ \leq k+1} \to A$ by $\varphi_{k+1} (\alpha_i) = v_i$ and 
   $\varphi_{k+1} (\beta_j) = w_j$. Now go to \ref{itm:first} and repeat the process.
 \end{enumerate}

\end{Algorithm}
%TODO Hier muss noch ein Beweis rein, dass der Algorithmus das tut was er soll

The next definition is about homotopy groups of a Sullivan algebra, of course they bear that name since we will later
associate them with homotopy groups of a topological space.

\begin{Definition}
 Let $\Sullivan$ be a Sullivan algebra, we define its complex of \emph{indecomposables} as
 $(Q(\Lambda V),\bar{d}) \coloneqq (\Lambda V / \Lambda^{\geq 2} V , \bar{d})$ where $\bar{d}$ is the induced differential.
 Given this we define the \emph{(dual) homotopy groups} of $\Sullivan$ by 
 $$ \pi^n ( \Sullivan) \coloneqq H^n(Q(\Lambda V),\bar{d}) \quad \text{for $n \geq 1$}$$
\end{Definition}

\begin{Remark}
 If $\Sullivan$ is a minimal Sullivan algebra then its homotopy groups can be obtained fairly simple. The minimality property
 implies that the differential on the complex of indecomposables of $\Sullivan$ is zero and hence taking
 homology does not change anything. Therefore, 
 $$ \pi^n ( \Sullivan) = H^n(Q(\Lambda V),0) \cong V^n$$
\end{Remark}

\subsection{Relative Sullivan algebras}

Sullivan algebras are sometimes not enough to describe some aspects and therefore introduce somehow more sophisticated
Sullivan algebras, called relative Sullivan algebras.

\begin{Definition}
 We call $(B \otimes \Lambda V,d)$ a \emph{relative Sullivan algebra} if it satisfies the following:
 
 \begin{itemize}
  \item $(B,d) \coloneqq (B \otimes 1, d)$ is a a connected sub cochain algebra.
  \item $1 \otimes V = V = { \lbrace V^p \rbrace}_{ p \geq 1}$ is a graded vector space.
  \item There is a filtration $V(0) \subseteq V(1) \subseteq V(2) \subseteq \ldots$ of graded subspaces
    with  $ V = \bigcup_{k = 0}^{\infty} V(k)$ such that 
    \begin{align*}
     d(V(0)) \subseteq B &  & \text{and} & & d(V(k)) \subseteq B \otimes \Lambda (V(k-1)) \quad \text{for $k \geq 1$.}
    \end{align*}
 \end{itemize}
 Moreover, $(B \otimes \Lambda V,d)$ is called \emph{minimal} if 
 $im \, d \subseteq B^{\geq 1} \otimes \Lambda V + B \otimes \Lambda^{\geq 2} V$.
\end{Definition}

\begin{Remark}
 Note that for $B = \Q$ the definition of Sullivan algebra and relative Sullivan algebra are the same.
\end{Remark}

\begin{Definition}
 A \emph{Sullivan model} for a morphism $\varphi \colon (B,d) \to (C,d)$ of commutative cochain algebras is
 a relative Sullivan algebra $\RelSullivan$ and a quasi isomorphism
 $$ m \colon \RelSullivan \overset{\simeq}{\to} (C,d) $$
 such that $\restr{m}{B} = \varphi$ 
\end{Definition}

\begin{Proposition}
 A morphism $\varphi \colon (B,d) \to (C,d)$ of commutative cochain algebras has a Sullivan model
 if $H^0(B) = \Q = H^0(C)$ and $H^1(\varphi)$ is injective.
\end{Proposition}
\begin{proof}
 Refer to \cite{Felix2001} (Proposition 14.3).
\end{proof}
